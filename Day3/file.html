    <h1> DORAEMON IS BEST</h1>

    <P> 
      Doraemon was well-received by critics and became a hit in many Asian countries.
       It won numerous awards, including the Japan Cartoonists Association Award in 1973 and 1994, 
      the Shogakukan Manga Award for children's manga in 1982, and the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 1997. 
      By 2019, it has sold over 250 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling manga series in history. 
      The Doraemon character has been viewed as a Japanese cultural icon, and was appointed as the first "anime ambassador" in 2008
       by the country's Foreign Ministry.
