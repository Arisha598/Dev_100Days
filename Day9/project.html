        <h4> DEATH</h4>
        <P> 
          On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on 
          "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong.
           While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort,
            but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest.[86] 
            At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, 
            he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; 
            upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life.[87] Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST.[87][89][90] His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly:
           "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"
